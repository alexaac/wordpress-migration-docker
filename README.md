# Wordpress Migration to Docker

**WordPress Migration Saga** is a series that presents the migration of an existing WordPress website to another host, in Docker. 

It was not suppose to become quite a *saga*, but it ended up being a very looong post and I had to split it. ðŸ™ƒ

This repo hosts the code examples.
